# Fleeing

Fleeing is an option that is available to the player on a section, if the author has `flee: true` set.  
It gives the player a chance to escape the story early and break the immersion of the story.

## Flow
When a player selects the Flee option, the bot will play the flee.md section, and then play the end.md section after that.
This allows you to have text specific to fleeing, before the credits and end are played.
